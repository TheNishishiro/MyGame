# About it
It's a simple rpg tibia-styled game made in C# using MonoGame framework as my school project for object oriented programming class.
Code is quite a mess, I never forced myself to actually finish it after getting my grade but it still have some cool stuff in there

# Features
* Randomly generated world
* Fully customizable with simple text files, meaing you can create your own items/spells/enemies/anything with just a notepad
* Custom save/load function (I didn't know about serialization back then :"D)
* Typical rpg stuff you would expect in any game
